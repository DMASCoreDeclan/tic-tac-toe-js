    <!-- While all of the code used in this file has been typed by the author, it is heavily influenced by a hybrid of designs from the following developers:
    Kyle from Web Dev Simplified using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM&t=939s - index.html.old and script.js.old
    Ania KubÃ³w from https://youtu.be/DRaWr0Dcbl0 - index.html.old and script.js.old
    Bro Code from https://youtu.be/AnmwHjpEhtA 
    Coding with Adam from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPew9OI2PnA&t=1906s
    Adam Khoury from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsSXzdn_0Gg - how to toggleMute in JS
    While some code just has to be the same, all Variable names, CSS names and Function names have been changed.  The design is fundamentally the same as Coding with Adam, with additional feature such as the Mute/Unmute Audio button.  The .wav sounds are downloaded from CodinWithAdma channel, but were renamed before upload and are called by different names in JS.
    The Favicon comes from https://icon-icons.com/icon/tic-tac-toe/39453 but was resized, renamed and recolored before being uploaded.-->
